# MacOS System Setup

The following instructions are for MacOS Ventura. If you have an earlier
operating system but have the option to update, we recommend doing so before
following the instructions below. If you are not able to update, earlier
operating systems may still be compatible with the requirements for the program,
but the instructions below may not always match what you see on your machine.

**Note**: Throughout the environment setup, you will see commands that look like
this:

```console
$ whoami
```

Any time you see a command like this with a `$` at the beginning, those commands
should be entered in your terminal **without** the `$`. So for the example
above, you would type `whoami` in the terminal (without a `$`).

## Check That Your MacOS System is Compatible with Flatiron School's Requirements

When working on software, it is important that your computer and the software
you're using are compatible. In this step, we'll ensure that you can install all
the tools you will need to complete the program.

### Action Item

1. Click on the Apple menu in the top left of the window.
2. Choose "About This Mac" from the menu.
3. Look for the version name (for example, "MacOS Big Sur").
4. Look for the version number (for example, "Version 11.4").

### Check Your Work

</iframe>

If your version name is Big Sur, Monterey or Ventura, and your version number is
greater than 11.4.0, your computer meets our requirements for the course and you
can continue below.

If your computer does not meet the requirements listed above, but you can
upgrade, we recommend that you do so before completing the environment setup.

If your computer does not meet the requirements and you can't upgrade, some
programs may not work for you. Please reach out to an instructor for more
information.

## Check that Your MacOS System Has Enough Space for Flatiron School's Requirements

The programs that we'll be installing during environment setup and all of the
work you'll do with Flatiron School will need at least 4 GB of free disk
space. Follow the steps below to ensure that you have enough disk space to
install all the needed programs.

### Action Item

1. Click on the Apple menu in the top left of the window.
2. Choose "About This Mac" from the menu.
3. Click the "More info..." button.
4. Scroll down to Storage and verify that at least 4GB of storage is available.

</iframe>

If your free space for your macOS partition is greater than 4 GB, continue
below. Otherwise, click "Storage Settings..." to see some recommendations for
freeing up space as well as some categories you can explore (Applications,
Documents, etc.) to find things you don't need anymore and can delete.

## Install Homebrew

[Homebrew][brew] is a package manager for MacOS. It allows us to quickly install
a number of programs we will need.

[brew]: https://brew.sh

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search".
2. Copy and paste the command: `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`, and press `<Enter>`.
3. Follow the prompts on the screen during the installation. (Note: this could
   take a while.)
4. After the installation has completed, you may be prompted to run two
   additional commands to add Homebrew to your PATH. If so, run those two
   commands in your terminal.
5. Close the "Terminal" application.
6. Reopen the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search".

### Check Your Work

</iframe>

You can verify that Homebrew is successfully installed by running `brew help`.
If your terminal outputs a list of `brew` commands, you're all set.

### Troubleshooting

If your machine has an M1 chip and you were unable to install Homebrew, try
running the following command, then continue from step 2 above:

```console
$ arch -x86_64 zsh
```

## Check Whether You Need to Install Zsh

Zsh is the new standard shell for the MacOS and comes pre-installed with recent
versions of MacOS, but it may need to be installed on older Macs.

### Action Item

1. Open the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
2. Type `echo $SHELL` and press `<Enter>`
3. **If you see `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/local/bin/zsh` DO NOT continue with the next
   steps. Move on to "Check Your Work".**

Otherwise, to install Zsh:

1. Type `brew install zsh` and press `<Enter>`
2. Type `echo /usr/local/bin/zsh | sudo tee -a /etc/shells` and press `<Enter>`
   (Note: you will need to enter your password.)
3. Type `chsh -s /usr/local/bin/zsh` and press `<Enter>`
4. Close the "Terminal" application
5. Reopen the "Terminal" application using "Spotlight Search"
6. If you receive a message starting with "This is the Z Shell configuration
   function for new users, zsh-newuser-install", press `0`.

### Check Your Work

If you run `echo $SHELL`, the terminal should output `/bin/zsh` or `/usr/local/bin/zsh`.
This indicates that Zsh is in use and you are set to continue below.

## Troubleshooting

If you see the following message when opening your terminal:

```console
zsh compinit: insecure directories, run compaudit for list.
Ignore insecure directories and continue [y] or abort compinit [n]?
```

Type `y` and press enter, then run the following command:

```console
$ compaudit | xargs chmod g-w
```

Close and reopen your terminal to clear the error.

application, continue to the next lesson, **Mac NodeJS Install**.
